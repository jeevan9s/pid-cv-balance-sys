## DESCRIPTION
- project with the scope of learning more about control theory and system design (PID), and embedded image processing (openCV).
- system prevents a ball from falling off a platform by controlling the position of the platform on two axes to keep the ball centered.
  
- a webcam tracks the ballâ€™s position, feeding x/y coordinates into two PID controllers that compute corrective tilt angles, which are sent to an Arduino program to drive the motors.

system's design is _modular_, there are 3 main modules.

1. VISION: processes the webcam stream, and detects, tracks, and sends the position of the ball to the Control module. also creates a HUD. (python)

2. CONTROL: computes the motor correction angles with the ball's positional coordinates via the PID algorithm/equation. (python)

3. ACTUATION: receives the correction angles, applies smoothing, and writes to each axis motor. (Arduino)
